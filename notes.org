* How The 'header' Component Was Created
- I created this manually as per the video within the 'src/app/header' directory

* How The 'recipes' Component Was Created 
- You can use the 'ng generate component' command, but I opted to use the alias version aka 'ng g c (name of new component)'
- I also used the '--skip-tests' parameter to prevent Angular from adding a testing file which isn't needed right now
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ng g c recipes --skip-tests
#+END_SRC

* How The 'recipe-list' Component Was Created
- I used the following command to place the new 'recipe-list' component into the already existing 'recipes' folder:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ng g c recipes/recipe-list --skip-tests
#+END_SRC

* How The 'recipe-detail' Component Was Created
- I used the following command to place the new 'recipe-detail' component into the already existing 'recipes' folder:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ng g c recipes/recipe-detail --skip-tests
#+END_SRC

* How The 'recipe-item' Component Was Created:
- I used the following command to place the new 'recipe-item' component into the already existing 'recipes/recipe-list' folder:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ng g c recipes/recipe-list/recipe-item --skip-tests
#+END_SRC

* How The 'shopping-list' Component Was Created:
- I used the following command:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ng g c shopping-list --skip-tests
#+END_SRC

* How The 'shopping-edit' Component Was Created:
- I used the following command to place the new 'shopping-edit' component within the existing 'shopping-list' folder:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ng g c shopping-list/shopping-edit --skip-tests
#+END_SRC

* How Other Components Were Modified
- I basically used their corresponding child components within the related parent HTML files within most of the parent components along with Bootstrap specific styling classes

* How Bootstrap Version 3 Was Installed
- NOTE: I didn't realize that the dependence on Bootstrap Version 3 was so heavy, so I had to figure that out the hard way, but basically if you just stick with 'npm install --save bootstrap@3', you will be good to go for this course

* How A Collapsable Hamburger Menu Was Added
- I followed along with the related '51. Alternative Non-Collapsable Navigation Bar' instructions, andded the following changes in the 'src/app/header/header.component.html' file:
#+BEGIN_SRC html
<div class="navbar-header">
  <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle" (click)="collapsed = !collapsed">
	<span class="icon-bar" *ngFor="let iconBar of [1, 2, 3]"></span>
  </button>
  <a routerLink="/" class="navbar-brand">Recipe Book</a>
</div>
<div class="navbar-collapse" [class.collapse]="collapsed" (window:resize)="collapsed = true">
#+END_SRC

I then added the following to the 'src/app/header/header.component.ts' file:
#+BEGIN_SRC ts 
collapsed = true;
#+END_SRC
